The Braes of Yarro
By: William Hamilton

`BUSK ye, busk ye, my bonnie, bonnie bride! 
 Busk ye, busk ye, my winsome marrow! 
Busk ye, busk ye, my bonnie, bonnie bride! 
 And think nae mair on the braes of Yarrow!? 

`Where got ye that bonnie, bonnie bride? 
 Where got ye that winsome marrow?? 
`I got her where I durst not well be seen? 
 Pu?ing the birks on the braes of Yarrow.? 

`Weep not, weep not, my bonnie, bonnie bride! 
 Weep not, weep not, my winsome marrow! 
Nor let thy heart lament to leave 
 Pu?ing the birks on the braes of Yarrow.? 

 
`Why does she weep, thy bonnie, bonnie bride? 
 Why does she weep, thy winsome marrow? 
And why dare ye nae mair weel be seen 
 Pu?ing the birks on the braes of Yarrow?? 

`Lang maun she weep, lang maun she, maun she weep, 
 Lang maun she weep with dule and sorrow; 
And lang maun I nae weel be seen 
 Pu?ing the birks on the braes of Yarrow.
